            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Imp Games operates a completely free, ad-supported platform that provides access to unblocked browser games and tools designed to help users bypass network restrictions commonly found in schools and workplaces. This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you in full detail about what information we and our third-party partners collect when you visit or interact with our website, how that information is used, stored, shared, and protected, and what rights and choices you have regarding your personal data under applicable privacy laws worldwide. By accessing or continuing to use https://studythemes.com or any of its subdomains, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy as well as our separate Terms of Service. If you do not agree with any part of this policy, you must immediately discontinue use of the Site. We reserve the right to update this policy at any time, and continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.</p>

        <section id="data">
            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

            <h3>2.1 Information You Provide Voluntarily</h3>
            <p>We only collect personal information that you explicitly and voluntarily provide to us, such as when you choose to fill out an optional contact form, submit a support request, sign up for future newsletters (if implemented), or send us direct messages through any communication channel we may offer. The types of information you might choose to provide include, but are not limited to, your email address, username, or any message content you submit. We do not require any personal information for core gameplay or basic site usage — registration is never mandatory. All voluntarily submitted information is used solely for the purpose for which it was provided (e.g., replying to your inquiry) and is never shared with third parties except as described in this policy or required by law. You are free to refuse to supply any personal information, though this may prevent you from using certain optional features.</p>

            <h3>2.2 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
            <p>When you visit our Site, certain information is automatically collected by our web server, content delivery network (Cloudflare), and third-party services including Google AdSense. This includes your IP address (used for security, fraud prevention, and basic geolocation), approximate geographic location derived from that IP (city/country level only), browser type and version, operating system, device type and characteristics, screen resolution, language preferences, referring URL, timestamps of your visit, pages viewed, time spent on each page, clicks, scrolls, and other interaction data. We also automatically log which games you launch and how long you play them for the purpose of improving game selection and site performance. None of this automatically collected data reveals your exact identity unless combined with other information you voluntarily provide. This data collection is standard across nearly all websites and is necessary for the Site to function properly, deliver content efficiently, and serve advertisements.</p>

            <h3>2.3 Cookies & Tracking Technologies</h3>
            <p>We and our third-party partners, including Google AdSense and its advertising partners, use cookies, browser localStorage, web beacons, pixels, and similar tracking technologies to operate essential site functions, remember your preferences (such as dark mode, volume, favorite games, and stealth settings), provide analytics about how the Site is used, detect and prevent abuse, and serve and measure advertisements. Some cookies are strictly necessary for the Site to work, while others are used for performance, functionality, and targeted advertising. You can control or delete cookies through your browser settings, though doing so may cause parts of the Site to stop working correctly. A complete, up-to-date list of all cookies used on the Site, including their purpose, duration, and whether they are first-party or third-party, is maintained in our separate Cookie Notice accessible via the footer. By continuing to use the Site, you consent to the placement of these cookies in accordance with this policy.</p>
            <h3>Cookie Consent & Google Consent Mode</h3>
            <p>We display a cookie consent banner to obtain your permission for non-essential cookies (including advertising and analytics). We implement Google Consent Mode v2 so that ads and analytics respect your choices, especially in regions with strict privacy laws like the EU. You can change your preferences at any time via browser settings or by clearing cookies.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the information we collect to deliver, operate, maintain, and improve the Site and its features; to serve advertisements that fund the entire platform and keep it free for all users; to remember your preferences across visits so you don’t have to reconfigure settings every time; to analyze usage patterns and determine which games and features are most popular; to detect, investigate, and prevent security threats, cheating, abuse, and fraudulent activity; to generate aggregated and anonymized statistics that help us make data-driven improvements; and to comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal processes, or enforceable governmental requests. We do not use your information for any purpose other than those explicitly stated in this policy. All processing of personal data is conducted in accordance with applicable privacy laws, including GDPR, CCPA, COPPA, and other relevant regulations. We regularly review our data collection and processing practices to ensure they remain necessary and proportionate.</p>
            <p>We have not sold or “shared” any personal data, and we do not intend to do so.</p>

        <section id="adsense">
            <h2>4. Google AdSense & Third-Party Advertising</h2>
            <p>We participate in the Google AdSense program to display advertisements, which is the sole way we generate revenue to keep the Site completely free for users worldwide. When advertisements load on our Site, Google and its certified advertising partners may set and access their own cookies on your device, collect information about your visits to this and other websites, and use that information to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you (known as personalized or interest-based advertising). Google’s use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to users based on their visit to our Site and/or other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of personalized advertising at any time by visiting Google’s Ads Settings<a href="https://adssettings.google.com"></a> or the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page. Google’s data practices are governed by its own Privacy Policy available at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy"></a>.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Sharing of Information</h2>
            <p>We do not sell, rent, lease, or trade your personal information to third parties for monetary consideration. We only share your information in the following limited circumstances: with Google LLC and its approved advertising partners for the purpose of serving and measuring advertisements; with Cloudflare, Inc. as our content delivery and security provider; with law enforcement agencies, government authorities, or other third parties when we are legally required to do so (such as in response to a subpoena, court order, or similar legal process); and with potential successors in the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In all cases, any third party that receives information from us is contractually or legally obligated to protect it in accordance with applicable privacy laws.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We retain security and abuse logs for up to 90 days, analytics data for up to 26 months (standard Google Analytics retention), first-party cookies for a maximum of 2 years, and any voluntarily submitted personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was provided or until you request deletion, whichever comes first. Once the retention period expires or the data is no longer needed, it is securely deleted or anonymized so that it can no longer be associated with you. We regularly review our retention practices to ensure compliance with applicable laws and to minimize the amount of data we hold.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We implement and maintain reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the information we collect, including HTTPS encryption across the entire Site, HSTS preload, Content Security Policy headers, Cloudflare web application firewall and DDoS protection, regular security updates, and restricted internal access to data. Despite these measures, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any credentials you use and for using a secure network when accessing the Site.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="highlight">
            <h2>8. Children’s Privacy (COPPA & Global Laws)</h2>
            <p>This Site is not intended for or directed to children under 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), Google AdSense policies, and similar laws worldwide impose strict requirements on websites that either target children under 13 or knowingly collect their personal information, including the requirement to obtain verifiable parental consent before any collection occurs. Because our Site displays Google AdSense advertisements, uses cookies and tracking technologies, embeds third-party games, and automatically receives IP addresses and usage data, implementing a verifiable parental consent mechanism on a completely free, ad-supported platform is not feasible. Therefore, children under 13 are prohibited from using the Site. If we discover that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13, we will delete that information immediately. Parents who believe their child under 13 has provided us with personal information should contact us at impgamessuppo@gmail.com for prompt removal.</p>

        <section id="rights">
            <h2>9. Your Privacy Rights – Worldwide (2025)</h2>
            <p>Depending on your location, you may have the following rights regarding your personal information: the right to access and receive a copy of the data we hold about you; the right to request correction of inaccurate data; the right to request deletion of your data; the right to object to or restrict certain types of processing; the right to data portability (receiving your data in a structured, commonly used format); the right to withdraw consent at any time where processing is based on consent; the right to opt out of targeted advertising or the “sale” or “sharing” of personal information as defined under California, Colorado, Virginia, and other state laws; and the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. We do not discriminate against users who exercise their privacy rights. All legitimate requests are processed free of charge within 30 days (or sooner if required by law). To exercise any of these rights, please email impgamessuppo@gmail.com with sufficient detail to identify your request.</p>
